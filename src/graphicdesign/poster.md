subtitle: A POSTER DESIGN FOR AN OPERA PLAY
tekst:
  The Rusalka opera play is presented by Opera Ballet Vlaanderen. For this design I used some line drawings, which create an abstract image of the play. So you will see a prince and a mermaid that fall in love, however they are separated from each other due to their different living spaces.
