<p>Here’s what’s new for designers and developers this month:</p>

### Ztext.Js

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Ztext.js</span> is an easy to implement, three-dimensional typography tool for the web that works with any font you want to use. With the popularity of 3D effects and animation, this tool has a lot of practical applications. Everything you need, including documentation, is available from developer Bennett Feely on his website and GitHub. (It’s free but you can show appreciation with a donation if you like it.)

### Gradient Magic

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Gradient Magic</span> is a free gallery of fun and interesting CSS gradients. You can sort through a random selection or by category of color to find just the right gradient for your project. Some of them would make really neat backgrounds or image overlays.

### Impossible Checkbox

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Impossible Checkbox</span> is a fun little divot that you’ll want to play with and emulate. Click or tap the slider to activate and a nifty little friend pops up. Now here’s the fun part: You can’t leave it checked, and take note of the changing expression of the checkbox character.
