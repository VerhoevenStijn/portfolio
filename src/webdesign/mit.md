tekst:
  I redesigned an online magazine from MIT Technology. Taking into account the mobile first principle, it is necessary to start designing for smartphones and afterwards for computers. The prominent colors in this design are white and black, because in my opinion they fit perfect together as they are opposites of each other. Furthermore I used a sidebar on the desktop version to easily navigate to other interesting articles.
