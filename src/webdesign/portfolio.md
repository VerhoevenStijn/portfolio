  This portfolio represents a roundup of my knowledge in web development. My brandname Stanny's hub is created as this is my common nickname. On top of that, the word 'hub' stands for network which I would like to expand. The orange color is used as main color in this design. Orange is associated with joy, enthusiasm, creativity, happiness and encouragement which describe my personality.
